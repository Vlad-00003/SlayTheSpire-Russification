Hello,

This week's patch brings in the Save Slot system, some balance changes, custom mods, and a few other tweaks here and there. Special thanks to our beta testers for helping us improve the UI for the Save Slot system!

[i]Now your guests won't ruin your winstreak[/i]

The Save Slots system allows players to create multiple saves in the game. Each slot tracks its own progress, playtime, and preferences. You can now also delete your save if you wish to start over. Note: Steam achievements are not removed when deleting profiles.
