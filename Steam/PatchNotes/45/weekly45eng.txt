Hey again,

This week's focus was on refining upcoming content, prepping for mod support, various bug fixes, and a new option to disable particle effects for low performance machines.

[h1]Disable Particle Effects[/h1]

We added a new option that removes particle effects from backgrounds and various effects.
This should improve performance for slower devices and decrease battery consumption for laptops.

[h1]Final Call for Translations[/h1]
When we leave Early Access, outdated translations will need to be removed. If there are any outdated languages that you want to see in the game, support and instructions for translation is always available at our [url=https://discord.gg/slayhtespire]Discord channel[/url].
